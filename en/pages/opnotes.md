## Laparoscopic

### Robotic Sacrocolpopexy
 
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed in the dorsal supine position. She then underwent an uncomplicated induction of general anesthesia. She was repositioned in dorsal lithotomy with her legs in Allen stirrups and she was on the Allen Steep Trend Positioner (bean bag). The vagina and abdomen were prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. A foley catheter was inserted into the bladder. 

The umbilicus was grasped with two Allis clamps and elevated. An 11 mm vertical skin incision was made with the scalpel through the umbilicus and carried down sharply to the fascia. The fascia was then grasped with two Kocher clamps and elevated and entered sharply with the scalpel. The peritoneum was identified and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors. An 11 mm Hasson trocar was then inserted into the abdomen and transfixed to the fascia with 0-Vicryl suture.

The abdomen was insufflated with CO2 gas. A 12 mm horizontal skin incision was then made approximately 10 cm left lateral to the umbilical trocar and an 11 mm trocar was inserted without difficulty under laparoscopic visualization. We then made an 8 mm horizontal skin incision 10 cm lateral to this point where an 8mm trocar was placed under laparoscopic visualization without difficulty. We then proceeded to place two more 8 mm trocars in the right side of the abdomen with the first being 10 cm lateral to the umbilical trocar and the second being 10 cm lateral to that. 

The patient was then placed in steep Trendelenburg and the DaVinci robotic system was docked without difficulty on the patient's right side.

We turned our attention to the sacral promontory. The bowel was swept to the patient's left to ensure adequate exposure. Peritoneum overlying the sacral promontory was then grasped, elevated, and incised vertically with monopolar scissors. The anterior longitudinal ligament was then identified and cleared. The peritoneal incision was then carried down along the right pelvic sidewall to the posterior vagina with care to stay medial to the right ureter.

The Lucite rod was then placed in the vagina. The bladder was noted to be adherent at the vaginal apex, likely secondary to her prior hysterectomy and cuff closure. We made an incision in the overlying peritoneum on the proximal posterior vaginal wall and carefully dissected the rectum off the posterior vagina down to the perienal body. We then dissected the bladder from the vaginal apex and anterior vagina using a combination of monopolar scissors, cold scissors, and blunt dissection.

A piece of Restorelle polypropylene Y-mesh was then introduced into the abdominal cavity with the anterior leaf trimmed to approximately 4 cm and the posterior leaf trimmed to approximately 7 cm. The anterior leaf of the mesh was then affixed to the anterior vaginal wall using 8 interrupted sutures of 2-0 PDS. The posterior leaf of the mesh was affixed to the posterior vaginal wall using 8 interrupted sutures of 2-0 PDS. We then placed two 2-0 Prolene sutures though the anterior longitudinal ligament approximately 2cm distal to the sacral promontory and appropriately tensioned the mesh. The sacral sutures were brought through the tail of the mesh and tied down. The excess tail of the mesh was trimmed and the peritoneum was reapproximated over the mesh using a running 2-0 Monocryl secured with Lapra-Tys on each end. Good hemostasis was noted.

We then performed a cystoscopic evaluation. The entire bladder was inspected in a clock-like and systematic fashion. There was no evidence of bladder injury, foreign body, or stone. Bilateral ureteral orifices were normal in appearance. Brisk ureteral jets were noted bilaterally.

We then replaced the Foley catheter and undocked the robot. The 12 mm trocar in the left abdomen was removed and the fascia was reapproximated with a free tie of 0-Vicryl using the Carter-Thomason device. The remaining trocars were removed and the pneumoperitoneum was evacuated. The fascial defect at the umbilicus was reapproximated using 0-Vicryl on a UR-6 needle in a running fashion. Skin incisions were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.

Attention was then turned to the posterior repair following the injection in the perineal body and posterior vaginal wall with 1:800,000 dilute epinephrine solution. An inverted triangular incision was made along the perineal body and carried up to the posterior vaginal wall. The vaginal mucosa was dissected off the underlying endopelvic connective tissue in the midline using the Metzenbaum scissors. The excess vaginal mucosa was excised. The mucosa and underlying tissue was plicated in the midline using an 0 Vicryl in a series of interrupted stitches. We then dissected out laterally to reach the levator muscles at the level of the hymen. These were plicated in the midline using 0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. We then reapproximated the perineal body using a #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The perineal skin was then reapproximated using a 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion. 

Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.
