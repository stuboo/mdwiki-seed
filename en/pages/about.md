Welcome.

I'm Ryan Stewart, a urogynecologist in Louisville, Kentucky.

I’m a practicing physician currently undergoing subspecialty training in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. To learn more about the subspecialty, I invite you to visit [VoicesForPFD.org](http://voicesforpfd.org) or [AUGS.org](http://augs.org).

Much of this site reflects my hobbies and interests. Like you, I have hobbies and interests not because I’m good at them, but because they are fun. I love to learn and want to get better, so your feedback is welcomed, but you probably won’t find perfection on anything written here. In short…this site and its contents are a toy.

A playground.

A sandbox.

You get the picture.

This site exists:
For the occasional blog post.
For sharing and discussing projects I’m working on or considering.
For getting better at git and markdown.
To serve as a landing place for everyone who sees my email address and says, “You have your own domain name?”
