Welcome.

I'm Ryan Stewart, a [urogynecologist](https://www.voicesforpfd.org/about/what-is-a-urogynecologist/) in Louisville, Kentucky. My professional research focuses on self-directed patient education, and my professional hobbies involve improving efficiency in patient care, streamlining physician workflow, and developing unique methods for teaching &amp; coaching patients.

In my spare time, I write Python code, make things with wood and microelectronics, and cook. I enjoy podcasts and politics.

You can reach me on Twitter or by dropping a line to ryan at ryanstewart dot com.
